"""
Batch evaluation harness (Week 4 / Phase 7).

Runs the full battery -- every repo x every model x all 3 representations -- scoring
each generated summary with two LLM-as-judge metrics (hallucination: are the claims
it made true; coverage: how much of the parser's ground truth did it mention), and
writes one flat CSV row per (repo, model, representation). That CSV is the results
table the report is built from; each row carries the efficiency metrics (latency,
tokens) alongside both quality metrics, so the representation ablation can be read
straight off it -- and so a summary that's faithful only because it said almost
nothing (high hallucination score, but also low coverage) doesn't look identical to
one that's faithful AND complete.

Runs as a script: `python -m app.evaluation.harness <url> [<url> ...] --out results.csv`.
Meant to run on the single designated evaluation machine (roadmap Section 1) so the
latency numbers are comparable -- running arms on different laptops makes them
meaningless.

    batched scorer, to skip the model download entirely.
